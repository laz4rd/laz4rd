## About Me

I enjoy building software from the ground up, starting with an idea and turning it into a functional, well-structured system. My interests lie in frontend architecture, mobile applications, and developer-focused tools. I prefer simplicity, clarity, and learning through hands-on projects rather than abstractions alone.
